# Ouroboros TUI Studio Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Build Ouroboros as a TUI-first automated pentest compiler/IDE with blackboard state, multi-agent orchestration, native toolchain integration, model/runtime telemetry, and Web/API, Infra/Internal, CTF/Lab domain packs.

**Architecture:** Implement a Go core with explicit state contracts first, then layer TUI, agent swarm, toolchain runtime, strategy patterns, and domain packs on top. Agents never mutate shared state directly; the Swarm Orchestrator validates structured outputs and writes to the Blackboard/Evidence Graph. The product path must target real workspaces, real toolchain manifests, real provider adapters, and real domain-pack execution from the beginning. Test doubles are allowed only inside automated tests and fixtures.

**Tech Stack:** Go 1.23+, Cobra CLI, Bubble Tea/Lip Gloss/Bubbles TUI, SQLite WAL, YAML schema validation, filesystem artifact vault, native tool bundle manifests, provider adapters for model telemetry.

---

## Scope And Decomposition

This is a platform program, not a single feature. Implement it as independently testable slices:

1. **Foundation:** repository scaffold, config, logging, event log.
2. **State Core:** Goal Stack, Blackboard Protocol, Evidence Graph, Artifact Vault.
3. **Execution Brain:** Sisyphus Engine, Breadth/Depth Controller, Strategy Pattern Library.
4. **Agent Runtime:** Swarm Orchestrator, agent driver contracts, provider-backed agents, model usage ledger.
5. **Tool Runtime:** Native Toolchain Runtime, corpus tools, Tool Compiler.
6. **TUI Studio:** workspace, conversation/workbench, graph panels, runtime panels.
7. **Domain Packs:** Web/API, Infra/Internal, CTF/Lab minimal complete loops.
8. **Replay And Reports:** timeline lanes, replay, report export.

## Execution Policy

- Do not build a demo or toy product path. The deliverable is a fully usable TUI-first pentest compiler.
- Mock providers, fake runners, and fixtures may exist only for `go test ./...`; production commands must use real workspace configuration, real toolchain manifests, and real provider adapters.
- Every production feature must write durable events, artifacts, or state projections that can be replayed, reported, and inspected in the TUI.
- Each milestone must leave the repository closer to a usable compiler, not only to a passing isolated unit test.

## Progress Documentation Requirement

After each milestone or implementation phase, create or update a progress document under:

```text
docs/progress/milestone-XX-<slug>.md
```

Each progress document must include:

- **Implemented:** concrete modules, commands, files, and behaviors completed.
- **Not Implemented:** planned capabilities still missing or intentionally deferred.
- **Validation:** commands run, test results, and any manual checks.
- **Next Step:** the exact next milestone/task to implement.
- **Risks / Decisions:** blockers, tradeoffs, architecture decisions, and unresolved questions.

Do not mark a milestone complete until its progress document is written.

- TUI status bar displays model, context, agents, breadth, depth, tools, and cost.
- Agent Graph and Attack Graph can be focused independently.
- Replay reconstructs timeline lanes from event log.
- Users do not need to manually install bottom-layer tools for bundled toolchain-supported runs.
- Every completed milestone has a progress document under `docs/progress/` covering implemented work, missing work, validation, next step, and risks/decisions.

## Plan Self-Review

- Spec coverage: TUI Studio, Blackboard Protocol, Sisyphus Engine, Breadth/Depth, Agent Swarm, Model Runtime, Native Toolchain, Tool Compiler, Domain Packs, Replay, and Reports each have implementation milestones.
- Placeholder scan: no unresolved placeholder markers, no vague future-work notes, and no open-ended "add tests" without concrete target.
- Type consistency: shared names are consistent with the architecture document: Goal Stack, Blackboard Protocol, Evidence Graph, Swarm Orchestrator, Strategy Pattern Library, Native Toolchain Runtime.
