// StepFromObservations schedules the next task from raw observations instead
// of intents. The observation-reasoning loop: every unprocessed observation
// must reach the model first — the model analyzes the evidence, forms or
// updates hypotheses, and only conclusions are recorded as facts. Intents
// stay in the state but are demoted to "hypotheses awaiting verification";
// they no longer drive scheduling while observation work remains.
//
// Scheduling rules, in priority order:
//  1. No facts, no intents, no observations → bootstrap (unchanged).
//  2. Any unprocessed observation → a reasoning task so the model analyzes
//     the raw evidence before anything else is scheduled. The Reason field
//     names the observations awaiting analysis, giving the reasoning step
//     its evidence list.
//  3. Otherwise fall back to the intent-based Step logic (backward
//     compatible), with intents read as hypotheses awaiting verification.
